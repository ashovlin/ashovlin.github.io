    <h1>Concert Liszt</h1>

<p>I use Goodreads for books and Letterboxd for movies, but only a shoebox for concert ticket stubs.</p>
<p><a href="https://bachtrack.com/">Bachtrack</a> is classical-focused and lets you log concerts from their catalog, which appears to only cover major cities. <a href="https://www.concertarchives.org/">Concert Archives</a> has an attractive set of features, but I think classical music has additional dimensions to track (composers, conductors, soloists) and benefits from a more focused app.</p>
<p>Concert Liszt lets you record concerts you've attended with the composers and pieces you heard at each one. </p>
<p><em>Built with Django, Bootstrap, and data from <a href="https://openopus.org/">Open Opus</a>, and hosted on Heroku</em></p>
