<p>I use <a href="http://strava.com">Strava</a> to track my running. Usually when I'm in the midst of a training plan I have a prescribed distance for each day. I have a few standbys from where I live for 3 mile, 5 mile, etc., distances but I tend to fall in a rut and repeat those over and over. </p>
<p>Variety is nice but so is having some familiarity with the route (lest I risk running farther than what was intended, or not knowing where the nearest bathroom is).</p>
<p>I wanted to search for routes of the given distance that I've run before. I couldn't find a way to do this in Strava's UI short of sorting all activities by distance and scrolling through the list. </p>
<p>Now you can specify a range of distances to view all your runs within that range:<br>
