<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> to learn German over the past year. I had started studying it in college a few years ago, but I only ended up taking one semester. I've found that Duolingo is a fun and free way to slowly keep at it.</p>
<p>Lessons on Duolingo are organized in a skill tree. As you complete a topic it turns gold. Over time each skill decays, prompting you to return to previous skills to review them.</p>
<p>After each lesson I navigate back to the home page, which starts at the top of the tree. I then skill down through the tree again, looking for the next non-gold lesson to review. This interaction bugged me a little bit. I was never really sure where the next lesson is, and I didn't want to skip a lesson and accidently let it decay further.</p>

<p>Duoscroll is a Chrome extension that adds a button to your Chrome menu that scrolls to your next lesson that needs review. </p>

<p>There's room for improvement - the Chrome store entry is pretty sparse, the icon can be spruced up, and perhaps it can be invoked from the context menu or a new element on the page instead of taking up a spot in the Chrome menu. But it works for my use case, and is out there for anyone else who is tired of scrolling too.</p>
