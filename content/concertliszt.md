Summary: "Goodreads for live, classical music"
[concertliszt.com](https://www.concertliszt.com)

I use Goodreads for books and Letterboxd for movies, but only a shoebox for concert ticket stubs.

[Bachtrack](https://bachtrack.com/) is classical-focused and lets you log concerts from their catalog, which appears to only cover major cities. [Concert Archives](https://www.concertarchives.org/) has an attractive set of features, but I think classical music has additional dimensions to track (composers, conductors, soloists) and benefits from a more focused app.

Concert Liszt lets you record concerts you've attended with the composers and pieces you heard at each one.
