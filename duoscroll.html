<p><strong><em>1/30/20 Update:</em></strong><br>
<em>I've since removed this from the Chrome Store. <a href="https://making.duolingo.com/crown-levels-a-royal-redesign">Duolingo redesigned skill trees in 2018</a> which removed the "decay" concept that the extension was searching for.</em>
<br /></p>
<p>I took one semester of German in college a few years ago and have been using <a href="http://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a> to slowly keep at it.</p>
<p>Lessons on Duolingo are organized in a skill tree. As you complete a topic it turns gold. Over time each skill decays, prompting you to return to previous skills to review them.</p>
<p>After each lesson I navigate back to the home page, which starts at the top of the tree. I then skill down through the tree again, looking for the next non-gold lesson to review. This interaction bugged me a little bit. I was never really sure where the next lesson is, and I didn't want to skip a lesson and accidently let it decay further.</p>

<p>Duoscroll is a Chrome extension that adds a button to your Chrome menu that scrolls to your next lesson that needs review. </p>
