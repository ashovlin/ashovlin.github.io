Summary: (A now deprecated) Chrome extension to fix a UX papercut on [Duolingo](http://duolingo.com).

***1/30/20 Update:***  
*I've since removed this from the Chrome Store. [Duolingo redesigned skill trees in 2018](https://making.duolingo.com/crown-levels-a-royal-redesign) which removed the "decay" concept that the extension was searching for.*

I took one semester of German in college a few years ago and have been using [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com) to slowly keep at it.

Lessons on Duolingo are organized in a skill tree. As you complete a topic it turns gold. Over time each skill decays, prompting you to return to previous skills to review them.

After each lesson I navigate back to the home page, which starts at the top of the tree. I then skill down through the tree again, looking for the next non-gold lesson to review. This interaction bugged me a little bit. I was never really sure where the next lesson is, and I didn't want to skip a lesson and accidently let it decay further.

Duoscroll is a Chrome extension that adds a button to your Chrome menu that scrolls to your next lesson that needs review.
